# bootcamp-hwk-wk1

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code of the Horiseon web application to improve accessibility. The main changes made to achieve this were:

- changing the <div> tags in the HTML to more semantically inclined tags such as <content>, <section> etc.
- improving the efficiency of the css given to avoid writing the same code more than once i.e. some selectors could be grouped together where they were applying the same style
- adding comments in css to improve readability
- adding alt attributes to the <img> tags
